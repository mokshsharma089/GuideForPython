# A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations.
# Python eases the programmers’ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.
# Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object.
# This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or be converted into a list of tuples using list() method.


# Syntax: enumerate(iterable, start=0)
#
# Parameters:
# Iterable: any object that supports iteration
# Start: the index value from which the counter is
#               to be started, by default it is 0


# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function
l1 = ["eat","sleep","repeat"]
s1 = "geek"

# creating enumerate objects
obj1 = enumerate(l1)
obj2 = enumerate(s1)

print "Return type:",type(obj1)
print list(enumerate(l1))

# changing start index to 2 from 0
print list(enumerate(s1,2))

#output of above code
        # Return type: < type 'enumerate' >
        # [(0, 'eat'), (1, 'sleep'), (2, 'repeat')]
        # [(2, 'g'), (3, 'e'), (4, 'e'), (5, 'k')]


# Using Enumerate object in loops

# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function in loops
l1 = ["eat","sleep","repeat"]

# printing the tuples in object directly
for ele in enumerate(l1):
    print ele
print
# changing index and printing separately
for count,ele in enumerate(l1,100):
    print count,ele

# Output
        # (0, 'eat')
        # (1, 'sleep')
        # (2, 'repeat')
        #
        # 100 eat
        # 101 sleep
        # 102 repeat
